A simple application called OpenFlights Airports has been developed at: https://mario-metriplica.shinyapps.io/MyShinyApp/

The OpenFlights Airports Database contains 7908 airports spanning the globe, as shown in the shiny app. The database contains some information about the location and the time zone.

In MyShinyApp you can see the data table output. It allows you to select the number of clusters to make (clustering depends on airport's latitude and longitude), and besides the country you want to view with leaflet.
